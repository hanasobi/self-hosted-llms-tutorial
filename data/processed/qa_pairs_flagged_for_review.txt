QUESTION:
  How does Amazon MQ handle version upgrades for RabbitMQ?

ANSWER: (532 chars)
  Amazon MQ will upgrade all brokers on the version to the next supported
  version after it reaches end of support. Users can manually upgrade their
  broker at any time to the next supported major or minor version. When
  automatic minor version upgrades are turned on, Amazon MQ will upgrade the
  broker to the latest supported patch version during the next maintenance
  window. From RabbitMQ version 3.13 onwards, Amazon MQ will manage the patch
  version for you and ensure all brokers are on the latest patch version of
  the minor version.

QUESTION:
  What are the differences in functionality between API Gateway's metering and operations monitoring features?

ANSWER: (570 chars)
  API Gateway's metering functionality focuses on defining plans that meter
  and restrict third-party developer access to APIs, including configuring
  throttling and quota limits on a per API key basis, and automatically
  metering traffic to extract utilization data for each API key. In contrast,
  operations monitoring provides a metrics dashboard to monitor calls to
  services after an API is published, integrating with Amazon CloudWatch to
  deliver backend performance metrics such as API calls, latency data, and
  error rates, along with enabling detailed metrics and logs.

QUESTION:
  How does throttling work in Amazon API Gateway?

ANSWER: (582 chars)
  Throttling in Amazon API Gateway ensures that API traffic is controlled to
  help backend services maintain performance and availability. It provides
  throttling at multiple levels, including global and by service call. API
  owners can set throttling limits for standard rates and bursts, such as a
  rate limit of 1,000 requests per second for a specific method and a burst
  limit of 2,000 requests per second for a few seconds. Any requests exceeding
  the limit will receive a 429 HTTP response, and client SDKs (except
  Javascript) automatically retry calls when faced with this response.

QUESTION:
  How does the machine learning inference process in Athena compare to the model training in SageMaker AI?

ANSWER: (520 chars)
  The machine learning inference process in Athena provides a SQL interface
  for predictions, allowing users to apply logic directly on their result sets
  with the ability to run inference during either the Select or Filter phase.
  In contrast, SageMaker AI focuses on model training and deployment, where

QUESTION:
  What is EMR Serverless and what advantages does it offer?

ANSWER: (571 chars)
  EMR Serverless is the easiest way to run Spark and Hive applications in the
  cloud and is the only serverless Hive solution in the industry. It
  eliminates the operational overhead of tuning, rightsizing, securing,
  patching, and managing clusters, allowing customers to only pay for the
  resources that their applications actually use. Additionally, it provides
  2x+ faster performance than standard open source due to EMR's
  performance-optimized runtime, which is 100% API compatible with standard
  open source, meaning applications do not need to be rewritten to run on EMR.

QUESTION:
  How does EMR Serverless differ from EMR clusters and EMR on EKS in terms of customer control and management?

ANSWER: (526 chars)
  EMR Serverless is designed for customers who want to avoid managing and
  operating clusters and simply want to run applications using open-source
  frameworks. In contrast, EMR clusters provide maximum control and
  flexibility, allowing customers to choose the EC2 instance type, customize
  the Amazon Linux Image AMI, and install additional custom software. EMR on
  EKS is for customers who want to standardize on EKS to manage clusters
  across applications or use different versions of an open-source framework on
  the same cluster.

QUESTION:
  How does Amazon Athena for Apache Spark compare to EMR Serverless in terms of user experience and application focus?

ANSWER: (566 chars)
  Amazon Athena for Apache Spark offers an instant on, interactive experience
  similar to the SQL-based query experience, specifically optimized for
  applications with short runtimes and requiring sub-second startup time. It
  handles performance tuning, configurations, software patching, and updates
  automatically without customer involvement. In contrast, EMR Serverless is
  aimed at customers who want to run applications using open-source frameworks
  without managing clusters, but it does not specifically focus on providing a
  similar interactive experience as Athena.

QUESTION:
  What are the steps to set up an SFTP connector for copying files to Amazon S3, and how do they compare to the steps for setting up AWS Transfer Family?

ANSWER: (655 chars)
  To set up an SFTP connector for copying files to Amazon S3, the steps are:
  first, create a secret to store the credentials for authentication; second,
  create the SFTP connector by supplying the secret and remote server’s URL;
  and third, start using the connector to copy files by invoking the
  StartFileTransfer API. In comparison, setting up AWS Transfer Family
  involves selecting the desired protocols, configuring user access via
  authentication options, and selecting the server to access S3 or EFS file
  systems. Both processes involve three main steps, but they differ in their
  specific actions and the focus on user access or connection configuration.

QUESTION:
  Why is it beneficial to use managed workflows for file processing in an organization?

ANSWER: (528 chars)
  Using managed workflows for file processing is beneficial because they
  remove the complexities of managing multiple tasks, provide a standardized
  file-processing solution that can be replicated across the organization, and
  include built-in exception handling and file traceability for each step.
  This helps meet business and legal requirements, allows for quicker
  deployment of workflows through Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and enables
  businesses to focus on their core differentiating work instead of managing
  infrastructure.

QUESTION:
  How do managed workflows in AWS Step Functions differ from existing solutions for file processing?

ANSWER: (527 chars)
  Managed workflows differ from existing solutions in several ways: 1) You
  can granularly define workflows to be executed only on full file uploads, as
  well as workflows to be executed only on partial file uploads; 2) workflows
  can be triggered automatically for S3 as well as EFS (which doesn’t offer
  post upload events); 3) workflows provide no code and pre-built options for
  common file processing like PGP decryption; and 4) customers can get end to
  end visibility into their file transfers and processing in CloudWatch logs.

  post-upload processing for full file uploads versus partial file uploads,
  Transfer Family events are published for file uploads in both S3 as well as
  EFS, and the events generated by Transfer Family contain operational
  information such as the username of the sender, server-id, transfer status,

QUESTION:
  What are the differences in cost for using public and private SSL/TLS certificates with AWS Certificate Manager?

ANSWER: (593 chars)
  Public and private SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through AWS Certificate
  Manager and used exclusively with ACM-integrated services, such as Elastic
  Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon API Gateway, are free.
  However, if you choose to issue exportable public certificates, you will
  incur costs for certificate issuance, certificate renewal, and related API
  usage. Additionally, there is a monthly fee for the operation of each
  private Certificate Authority (CA) until it is deleted, and for private
  certificates that are issued and not used exclusively with ACM-integrated
  services.

QUESTION:
  What types of certificates does ACM provide, and how do they differ in terms of trust by browsers?

ANSWER: (510 chars)
  ACM provides both public and private certificates. Public certificates are
  trusted by most modern browsers, operating systems, and mobile devices,
  achieving 99% browser and operating system ubiquity. They are verified by
  Amazon’s certificate authority and are recognized by any browser,
  application, or OS that includes the Amazon Root CA. In contrast, the
  context does not provide specific details about the trust characteristics of
  private certificates, only mentioning the public certificates' trust levels.

QUESTION:
  How does the renewal process for private certificates differ based on their management options?

ANSWER: (563 chars)
  The renewal process for private certificates varies based on how they are
  managed. For private certificates issued with AWS Private CAs and used with
  ACM-integrated services, ACM can fully automate renewal and deployment as
  long as the private CA remains in the Active state. In contrast, for private
  certificates exported from ACM for use with on-premises resources, EC2
  instances, and IoT devices, ACM automatically renews the certificate, but
  the user is responsible for retrieving the new certificate and private key
  and deploying them with their application.

  What events trigger Lambda@Edge functions in Amazon CloudFront?

ANSWER: (724 chars)
  Lambda@Edge functions are automatically triggered in response to four
  Amazon CloudFront events: Viewer Request, Viewer Response, Origin Request,
  and Origin Response. The Viewer Request event occurs when an end user or
  device makes an HTTP(S) request to CloudFront at the nearest edge location.
  The Viewer Response event occurs when the CloudFront server at the edge is
  ready to respond to the end user. The Origin Request event happens when the
  CloudFront edge server does not have the requested object in its cache and
  is ready to send the viewer request to the backend origin webserver.
  Finally, the Origin Response event occurs when the CloudFront server at the
  edge receives a response from the backend origin webserver.

  How does continuous deployment on CloudFront enhance deployment safety?

ANSWER: (527 chars)
  Continuous deployment on CloudFront enhances deployment safety by allowing
  you to deploy two separate but identical environments—blue and green. This
  setup enables you to test and validate configuration changes with a portion
  of live traffic before deploying changes to all viewers. It also allows for
  gradual rollouts without DNS changes and ensures session stickiness, thereby
  providing a consistent experience for viewers. Additionally, you can monitor
  performance and quickly revert to the previous configuration if needed.

QUESTION:
  What is the difference between the Viewer Request and Origin Request events in CloudFront?

ANSWER: (573 chars)
  The Viewer Request event occurs when an end user or device makes an HTTP(S)
  request to CloudFront, and this request is received at the edge location
  closest to that user. In contrast, the Origin Request event occurs when the
  CloudFront edge server does not already have the requested object in its
  cache and is preparing to send the viewer request to the backend origin
  webserver. Essentially, the Viewer Request is the initial request from the
  end user, while the Origin Request is the subsequent action taken by
  CloudFront when it needs to fetch content from the backend.

  AWS CloudHSM has both physical and logical tamper detection and response
  mechanisms that trigger key deletion (zeroization) if tampering is detected.
  The hardware is designed to notice breaches of its physical barrier.
  Additionally, HSMs are protected against brute-force login attacks: after a
  fixed number of unsuccessful attempts to access an HSM with admin or crypto
  officer (CO) credentials, the HSM will lock the admin/CO out. Similarly,
  after a set number of unsuccessful attempts with crypto user (CU)
  credentials, the user will be locked out and must be unlocked by a CO or

QUESTION:
  What is the process for rotating private keys for signing in AWS CloudHSM?

ANSWER: (582 chars)
  To rotate private keys for signing in AWS CloudHSM, you first create a new
  private key and generate the corresponding CSR using OpenSSL on AWS
  CloudHSM. Then, you sign the CSR with the same offline enterprise root. You
  may need to register this new certificate with any partners who do not
  automatically verify the entire certificate chain. Moving forward, you will
  sign all new requests with the new private key corresponding to the new
  certificate, while you can still verify signatures from the original private
  key using the corresponding public key. No revocation is necessary.

  How does the key rotation process differ for private keys used for signing compared to symmetric keys used for envelope encryption?

ANSWER: (548 chars)
  The key rotation process for private keys used for signing involves
  creating a new private key, generating a CSR, signing it with an offline
  enterprise root, and registering the new certificate if necessary. In
  contrast, the key rotation process for symmetric keys used for envelope
  encryption involves decrypting data keys with the old wrapping key and
  re-encrypting them with a new wrapping key. The key for envelope encryption
  is created and used on AWS CloudHSM, while for signing, the new private key
  corresponds to a newly issued certificate.

  action is made, then delivered to the Region associated with your S3 bucket.
  In contrast, for services with single endpoints, like IAM and AWS STS, the
  activity information is captured in the Region where the endpoint is
  located, processed in the Region where the CloudTrail trail is configured,
  and then delivered to the Region associated with your S3 bucket.

QUESTION:
  How does AWS Compute Optimizer provide recommendations for Lambda functions that may be overprovisioned in memory sizes compared to those that may benefit from additional CPU power?

ANSWER: (554 chars)
  AWS Compute Optimizer provides recommendations for two categories of Lambda
  functions: the first category includes functions that may be overprovisioned
  in memory sizes, for which it suggests downsizing the memory to save costs.
  The second category includes compute-intensive functions that may benefit
  from additional CPU power, for which it suggests increasing their memory
  sizes to trigger an equivalent increase in available CPU and reduce runtime.
  For functions not falling under these categories, Compute Optimizer does not
  deliver recommendations.

QUESTION:
  How does AWS Compute Optimizer calculate the performance risk score for a recommended instance?

ANSWER: (509 chars)
  Compute Optimizer calculates an individual performance risk score for each
  resource dimension of the recommended instance, including CPU, EBS
  throughput, EBS IOPS, and network throughput. The performance risk score is
  computed as the proportion of time over the historical lookback period where
  capacity may be constrained in the given resource dimension. The overall
  performance risk of the recommended instance is determined as the maximum
  performance risk score across the analyzed resource specifications.

QUESTION:
  What is AWS Config and what capabilities does it provide?

ANSWER: (522 chars)
  AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides resource inventory,
  configuration history, and configuration change notifications for security
  and governance. With AWS Config, users can discover existing AWS resources,
  record configurations for third-party resources, export a complete inventory
  of resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource
  was configured at any point in time. Its capabilities include compliance
  auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.

  What is the difference between AWS Config rules and conformance packs?

ANSWER: (530 chars)
  AWS Config rules represent desired configurations for individual resources
  and are evaluated against configuration changes, providing insights on
  compliance and risk for those resources. In contrast, a conformance pack is
  a collection of AWS Config rules and remediation actions that is built using
  a common framework. Conformance packs simplify the deployment and reporting
  of governance policies and configuration compliance across multiple accounts
  and Regions, while AWS Config rules focus on specific resource
  configurations.

ANSWER: (571 chars)
  A Configuration Item (CI) consists of five sections: basic information
  about the resource that is common across different resource types (such as
  Amazon Resource Names and tags), configuration data specific to the resource
  (such as EC2 instance type), a map of relationships with other resources
  (such as EC2::Volume vol-3434df43 is 'attached to instance' EC2 Instance
  i-3432ee3a), CloudTrail event IDs related to this state (only for AWS
  resources), and metadata that helps identify information about the CI, such

QUESTION:
  How does AWS Config handle changes made to a resource's configuration in quick succession?

ANSWER: (567 chars)
  AWS Config detects changes to a resource's configuration and records the
  configuration state resulting from that change. In cases where several
  configuration changes are made in quick succession, AWS Config will record
  only the latest configuration of that resource that represents the
  cumulative impact of the set of changes. It will list only the latest change
  in the relatedEvents field of the Configuration Item, allowing users and
  programs to continue changing infrastructure configurations without waiting
  for AWS Config to record intermediate transient states.

  for investigating findings and with Amazon EventBridge for remediation
  actions. In contrast, AWS Config conformance packs allow users to assemble
  their own compliance or security standards, which can include various
  checks, and simplify the management of AWS Config rules through packaging.
  This means Security Hub CSPM focuses on using predefined standards while
  Config conformance packs enable customization.

  An aggregator in AWS Config enhances compliance visibility by collecting
  AWS Config data from multiple accounts and Regions. It allows users to view
  the resource configuration and compliance data recorded on AWS Config for
  these accounts and Regions. The aggregated view displays the total count of
  non-compliant rules, the top five non-compliant rules by number of
  resources, and the top five AWS accounts with the highest number of
  non-compliant rules, enabling more detailed analysis of compliance issues.

QUESTION:
  How does the buffer size and buffer interval affect data delivery to Amazon S3 in Firehose?

ANSWER: (529 chars)
  The frequency of data delivery to Amazon S3 is determined by the S3 buffer
  size and buffer interval value configured for the Firehose stream. Firehose
  buffers incoming data before delivering it to Amazon S3, and data delivery
  is triggered by the condition that is satisfied first between the buffer
  size (ranging from 1 MB to 128 MB) or buffer interval (ranging from 0 to 900
  seconds). Additionally, if data delivery is falling behind data ingestion,
  Firehose automatically raises the buffer size to ensure all data is
  delivered.

  in a dataset, and it sequentially prepares, transfers, and verifies files,
  making it slower than Enhanced mode. In contrast, Enhanced mode allows for
  transferring datasets with virtually unlimited numbers of objects at higher
  performance levels and optimizes the process by handling listing,
  preparation, transfer, and verification in parallel. Enhanced mode also
  provides enhanced metrics and reporting capabilities.

QUESTION:
  How does AWS DataSync handle file and folder metadata when transferring data to and from Amazon S3?

ANSWER: (554 chars)
  When files or folders are copied to Amazon S3, there is a one-to-one
  relationship between a file or folder and an object. File and folder
  timestamps and POSIX permissions, including user ID, group ID, and
  permissions, are stored in S3 user metadata. When DataSync copies objects
  containing this user metadata back to an NFS server, the file metadata is
  restored. Additionally, when copying from an SMB file share, default POSIX
  permissions are stored in S3 user metadata, and ownership is set based on
  the user configured in DataSync for that file share.

  How does AWS DataSync handle network access when creating a task for an FSx for Lustre file system compared to an FSx for Windows File Server file system?

ANSWER: (562 chars)
  When you create a DataSync task for an FSx for Lustre file system, the
  DataSync service creates Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) in the same VPC
  and subnet as the file system, using the Lustre protocol as the root user.
  In contrast, for the FSx for Windows File Server, the context does not
  specify the use of ENIs or the Lustre protocol, suggesting a different
  mechanism for access. Additionally, the security groups for FSx for Lustre
  must allow outbound traffic for required network ports as well as inbound
  access from the assigned DataSync security groups.

QUESTION:
  In what ways can Amazon DocumentDB instances be accessed compared to Amazon RDS instances?

ANSWER: (553 chars)
  Amazon DocumentDB instances can be accessed directly by Amazon EC2
  instances or other AWS services deployed in the same Amazon Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC), and also from different VPCs in the same region or other
  regions via VPC peering. In contrast, while Amazon RDS instances also
  operate within a VPC, the specifics of their access mechanisms and any
  additional features may differ based on their design and intended use cases.
  The context does not provide detailed access information for Amazon RDS, so
  a direct comparison in this regard is limited.

QUESTION:
  How does semantic search differ from traditional keyword search in Amazon DocumentDB?

ANSWER: (581 chars)
  Semantic search differs from traditional keyword search in that it captures
  the meaning, context, and intent behind the data. While keyword search finds
  documents based on the actual text or pre-defined synonym mappings, semantic
  search can retrieve results that are contextually related, even if they do
  not contain the exact keywords. For example, in a traditional e-commerce
  application, keyword search for a 'red dress' would return products with
  those exact terms, whereas semantic search could return dresses in different
  shades of red, thereby improving the user experience.

  How do the performance characteristics of Amazon EBS volume types compare to each other?

ANSWER: (507 chars)
  Amazon EBS provides six volume types: Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block
  Express and io1), General Purpose SSD (gp3 and gp2), Throughput Optimized
  HDD (st1), and Cold HDD (sc1). These volume types differ in performance
  characteristics and price, allowing users to tailor their storage
  performance and cost to the needs of their applications. For instance, the
  average latency between EC2 instances and EBS is single-digit milliseconds,
  while the average latency of io2 Block Express volumes is sub-millisecond.

QUESTION:
  How does the I/O size of an application affect the performance of HDD-backed volumes?

ANSWER: (518 chars)
  The throughput rate for HDD-backed volumes depends on the I/O size of the
  application's reads and writes. These volumes process reads and writes in
  I/O sizes of 1MB. Sequential I/Os are merged and processed as 1MB units,
  while non-sequential I/Os are processed as 1MB even if the actual I/O size
  is smaller. Therefore, workloads with small, random I/Os, like a database,
  will not perform well on HDD-backed volumes, whereas sequential I/Os and
  large I/O sizes will achieve the advertised performance for a longer time.

  The key differences between hibernating and stopping an instance are that
  when you hibernate an instance, the RAM data is persisted, allowing the
  instance to resume from its previous state, while stopping an instance
  clears the RAM. In both cases, data from the EBS root volume and attached
  EBS data volumes is persisted, and the private IP address remains the same,
  as does the elastic IP address if applicable. Both options are available

  user's budget and cash flow. The All Upfront option requires a single
  payment, which may be beneficial for those who prefer to manage costs
  upfront. The Partial Upfront option allows for lower initial payments while
  still receiving a discount on hourly rates, making it easier to manage
  ongoing operational costs. The No Upfront option provides flexibility by not

  For list values less than $500k, there is no discount. For list values
  between $500k and $4M, users receive a 5% discount on both upfront and
  hourly payments. For list values between $4M and $10M, the discount
  increases to 10% on both payments. For list values exceeding $10M, users are
  advised to call for further assistance, implying that specific terms may
  apply at that level.

QUESTION:
  What steps do I need to follow to list an RI for sale in the Amazon EC2 console?

ANSWER: (598 chars)
  To list an RI for sale, you need to follow these steps in the Amazon EC2
  console: First, select the RIs that you wish to sell and choose 'Sell
  Reserved Instances.' If you have not completed the registration process, you
  will be prompted to register using the registration pipeline. Next, for each
  RI type, set the number of instances you’d like to sell and the one-time fee
  you want to set. You can set the one-time price to different amounts based
  on the time remaining. Then, after configuring your listing, a final
  confirmation screen will appear, and you should choose 'Sell Reserved
  Instance.'

  What is the difference in charges for a Spot instance that is stopped by the user versus one that is terminated by Amazon EC2?

ANSWER: (556 chars)
  If a Spot instance is stopped or terminated by Amazon EC2 within the first
  instance hour, you will not be charged for that usage. However, if you stop
  or terminate the Spot instance yourself, you will be charged to the nearest
  second. For any subsequent hour, if the Spot instance is terminated or
  stopped by Amazon EC2, you will also be charged for your usage to the
  nearest second. Additionally, if you are running on Windows or Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and you stop or terminate the Spot instance
  yourself, you will be charged for an entire hour.

ANSWER: (524 chars)
  The key differences in how NVMe drivers and Xen paravirtual block drivers
  behave when accessing EBS volumes include the naming of NVMe devices, which
  are enumerated by Linux based operating systems as /dev/nvme0n1,
  /dev/nvme1n1, etc., compared to the parameters for EBS volume attachment
  requests that use names like /dev/xvda and /dev/xvdf. Additionally, NVMe

  flexible rules for how your applications run on different types of compute
  capacity and manage the scaling of that capacity. Capacity providers work
  with both Amazon EC2 and AWS Fargate, providing predefined capacity
  providers for AWS Fargate and Fargate-Spot capacities for every cluster. For
  Amazon EC2, you can create your own Auto Scaling Group (ASG) capacity
  providers to manage scaling.

  What is the default throughput mode for Amazon EFS and what are its characteristics?

ANSWER: (525 chars)
  The default throughput mode for Amazon EFS is Elastic Throughput. This mode
  is suitable for most file workloads as it automatically scales performance
  with your workload activity. Users only pay for the throughput they use,
  which is based on the data transferred for their file systems per month.
  Elastic Throughput is ideal for applications with uncertain peak throughput
  needs or for those that have very spiky workloads with low baseline
  activity, using less than 5% of capacity on average when provisioned for
  peak needs.

  management. It allows developers to generate and download code bindings for
  schemas, enabling the use of strongly-typed objects directly in their code.

QUESTION:
  What does AWS Global Accelerator do to ensure high availability for applications?

ANSWER: (520 chars)
  AWS Global Accelerator ensures high availability for applications by using
  a fault-isolating design that increases application availability. When an
  accelerator is created, it is allocated two IPv4 static IP addresses
  serviced by independent network zones. These network zones are isolated
  units with their own physical infrastructure, allowing for fault tolerance.
  If one static IP address becomes unavailable, AWS Global Accelerator
  reroutes traffic to a healthy static IP address from the other isolated
  network zone.

ANSWER: (687 chars)
  The key differences between Global Accelerator's IP addresses and EC2
  Elastic IP addresses are: 1) Global Accelerator's IP addresses can be
  associated with multiple endpoints in various AWS Regions, allowing for
  easier scaling across multiple Availability Zones or Regions, while Elastic
  IPs are tied to a single resource in one AWS Region. 2) Global Accelerator's
  IP addresses support only client-generated connections, whereas Elastic IPs
  support both client and server-generated connections. 3) Global
  Accelerator's IP addresses are advertised from AWS's extensive network of
  edge locations for optimal performance, while Elastic IPs are advertised
  from a single AWS Region at a time.

  application logic, while a standard accelerator automatically routes traffic
  to the nearest healthy endpoint and does not allow for deterministic routing
  of multiple users to a specific EC2 destination. Additionally, standard
  accelerators support various endpoint types such as Network Load Balancers
  and Application Load Balancers, whereas custom routing accelerators only
  support VPC subnet endpoints containing EC2 instances.

  RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) assigns permissions based on a person's
  job function by defining IAM roles with specific permissions. Users can
  assume these roles to perform their job functions, and access can be audited
  by examining the IAM roles and their attached permissions. In contrast, ABAC
  (Attribute-Based Access Control) defines permissions based on attributes
  called tags. ABAC allows for fine-grained permissions to specific resources
  by matching the tags on roles or sessions with those on the resources,
  making it more adaptable in dynamic environments.

  How do the scanning processes for Lambda functions compare to those for Amazon EC2 instances?

ANSWER: (535 chars)
  The scanning process for Lambda functions involves an initial assessment
  upon discovery and continuous reassessment whenever there is an update or a
  new CVE published. In contrast, Amazon EC2 instances are scanned initially
  upon discovery and rescanned based on specific triggers such as software
  package changes or new CVEs, particularly for those using the SSM agent.
  This shows that while both are initially assessed, Lambda functions are
  continuously reassessed, whereas EC2 instances have specific conditions that

ANSWER: (585 chars)
  Enhanced Fan-Out incurs costs based on consumer-shard hours and data
  retrievals, which are determined by the number of shards and the amount of
  data delivered to consumers. In contrast, Extended Data Retention incurs
  costs based on the number of shard hours for the data stream when extended
  retention is enabled, resulting in a charge for each shard in the stream at
  the extended retention rate. Therefore, while both are optional costs, they
  are based on different metrics: Enhanced Fan-Out focuses on consumer usage,
  whereas Extended Data Retention focuses on shard usage over time.

  AWS KMS provides three types of keys for managing encryption: customer

  KMS keys are fully controlled by you, allowing you to define access control
  and usage policies. AWS managed KMS keys are created in your account but
  managed by AWS, and while you can track them and see usage logs in
  CloudTrail, you do not have direct control over these keys. AWS owned keys
  are fully owned and operated by AWS accounts, providing automation for
  encryption but lacking policy controls and CloudTrail logs.

QUESTION:
  How does envelope encryption improve performance when using AWS KMS?

ANSWER: (551 chars)
  Envelope encryption improves performance by reducing the network load when
  encrypting data with AWS KMS. When you encrypt data directly with AWS KMS,
  the entire block of data must be transferred over the network, which can
  lead to latency. In contrast, envelope encryption only requires the transfer
  of a much smaller data key over the network, while the actual data is
  encrypted locally in your application or the encrypting AWS service. This
  approach minimizes the amount of data sent over the network, resulting in
  significant performance benefits.

QUESTION:
  How do imported keys differ from AWS managed keys in AWS KMS?

ANSWER: (558 chars)
  Imported keys differ from AWS managed keys in that imported keys allow for
  greater control over key creation, lifecycle management, and durability.
  While AWS managed keys are created by AWS services and are free to store,
  imported keys can be symmetric, asymmetric (RSA and elliptic curve), or HMAC
  keys that the customer wraps using an AWS KMS-provided public key.
  Additionally, customers can maintain a secure copy of imported keys in their
  own infrastructure and immediately delete them from AWS infrastructure,
  which is not a feature of AWS managed keys.

QUESTION:
  What are the differences in the encryption process between using AWS KMS and an external key manager with XKS Proxy?

ANSWER: (508 chars)
  When using AWS KMS, the plaintext data key is encrypted by a key stored in
  AWS KMS unique to your AWS account, resulting in an encrypted data key. This
  encrypted data key is then forwarded to the XKS Proxy implementation, where
  it is encrypted a second time under the key defined in your external key
  manager. In contrast, if only AWS KMS were used, the data key would only be
  encrypted once. Thus, the key difference lies in the double-encryption
  process involving both AWS KMS and the external key manager.

ANSWER: (615 chars)
  The number of images required to train an anomaly detection model in Amazon
  Lookout for Vision depends on the variability in the production line and the
  quality of the training data. For scenarios with constant conditions like
  lighting and alignment, as few as 30 images can be sufficient to start,
  while more complex cases with many variations may require hundreds of
  high-quality training examples. Although a high number of images is
  beneficial for achieving high accuracy, users can initially train a model
  with fewer images, review test results, and iteratively improve the model by

  contrast, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is specifically optimized
  for monitoring container-based workloads and offers Prometheus-compatible
  APIs for ingesting and querying Prometheus metrics, focusing solely on
  metrics without collecting logs or traces.

QUESTION:
  How does Amazon MSK ensure the security of its resources within a VPC?

ANSWER: (506 chars)
  Amazon MSK always runs within an Amazon VPC managed by the Amazon MSK
  service. The resources will be available to your own Amazon VPC, subnet, and
  security group that you select when the cluster is set up. IP addresses from
  your VPC are attached to Amazon MSK resources through ENIs, and all network
  traffic stays within the AWS network and is not accessible to the internet
  by default. The security groups on the ENIs will dictate the source and type
  of ingress and egress traffic allowed on your brokers.

QUESTION:
  What is the difference between enabling public access and keeping Amazon MSK resources private?

ANSWER: (532 chars)
  Enabling public access allows authorized clients external to a private
  Amazon VPC to stream encrypted data in and out of specific Amazon MSK
  clusters running Apache Kafka 2.6.0 or later versions. In contrast, keeping
  Amazon MSK resources private means that all network traffic stays within the
  AWS network and is not accessible to the internet by default. Public access
  can be enabled for MSK clusters after a cluster has been created at no
  additional cost, but standard AWS data transfer costs for cluster ingress
  and egress apply.

  How does the active threat defense managed rule groups differ from existing managed rule groups in AWS Network Firewall?

ANSWER: (526 chars)
  Active threat defense managed rule groups differ from existing Domain, IP,
  and threat signature managed rule groups primarily because they are based on
  Amazon threat intelligence. This capability focuses on providing rapid
  protection against active threats identified by Amazon threat intelligence,
  and when an active threat is detected, AWS Network Firewall automatically
  applies managed rules to block it. Active threat defense is designed to
  complement other managed rule groups, offering an additional layer of
  protection.

QUESTION:

ANSWER: (650 chars)
  To configure AWS Network Firewall TLS inspection, you need to follow a
  3-step process: 1) provision certificates and keys, 2) create a TLS
  inspection configuration, and 3) apply the configuration to a firewall
  policy. In contrast, enabling active threat defense managed rule groups can
  be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, and
  involves selecting the active threat defense rule group within the AWS
  managed rule groups dropdown when creating or updating a firewall policy.
  Thus, TLS inspection requires a defined setup process while active threat
  defense can be enabled directly through a selection in the firewall policy.

QUESTION:
  Why is it recommended to use three Availability Zones (AZs) when configuring Amazon OpenSearch Service, even with one replica?

ANSWER: (519 chars)
  It is recommended to use three AZs because if an AZ disruption occurs in a
  three AZ domain, you only lose one-third of your capacity. In contrast, if
  the disruption occurs in a two AZ domain, you lose half your capacity, which
  can be more disruptive. Additionally, in a three AZ domain, if one AZ is
  disrupted, Amazon OpenSearch Service can fall back to the two remaining AZs
  and still support cross-AZ replication, while a two AZ domain loses cross-AZ
  replication if one AZ is disrupted, further reducing availability.

  What is the primary difference between the 'Zone Awareness' option and the Multi-AZ with Standby option in terms of capacity handling?

ANSWER: (507 chars)
  The primary difference between the 'Zone Awareness' option and the Multi-AZ
  with Standby option is how redundant or additional capacity is handled to
  maintain availability. Multi-AZ with Standby requires at least one copy of
  data in each AZ to explicitly reserve capacity in one AZ as standby, which
  acts as a failover target during AZ disruption or instance failure. In
  contrast, the existing model requires maintaining optimum levels of
  resources to serve the workload without a specific standby capacity.

  from an operational datastore to a search datastore. In contrast,
  traditional data pipelines can be challenging and costly to build and
  manage, often suffering from intermittent errors that are difficult to

  real-time search results from transactional data, which is not typically the
  case with traditional data pipelines.

  How does a Multi-AZ deployment improve data durability compared to standard deployments in a single AZ?

ANSWER: (579 chars)
  A Multi-AZ deployment safeguards your data in the event of a DB instance
  component failure or loss of availability in one Availability Zone. For
  example, if a storage volume on your primary fails, Amazon RDS automatically
  initiates a failover to the standby, where all of your database updates are
  intact. This provides additional data durability relative to standard
  deployments in a single AZ, where a user-initiated restore operation would
  be required, and updates that occurred after the latest restorable time
  (typically within the last five minutes) would not be available.

QUESTION:
  How do the behaviors of Amazon RDS for MySQL or MariaDB read replicas compare to those of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL read replicas when the source DB Instance is deleted?

ANSWER: (525 chars)
  Both Amazon RDS for MySQL or MariaDB read replicas and Amazon RDS for
  PostgreSQL read replicas will stay active and continue accepting read
  traffic after their corresponding source DB Instance is deleted. However, in
  the case of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, all read replicas will be promoted to
  standalone DB Instances that can accept both read and write traffic upon
  deletion of the source DB Instance, whereas the MySQL or MariaDB read
  replicas do not automatically promote to standalone instances unless
  explicitly deleted.

QUESTION:
  What limitations apply to free backup storage on DS2 or DC2 clusters in Amazon Redshift, and how does this differ from RA3 clusters?

ANSWER: (506 chars)
  On DS2 or DC2 clusters, free backup storage is limited to the total size of
  storage on the nodes in the data warehouse cluster and only applies to
  active data warehouse clusters. For example, if a data warehouse has total
  storage of 8 TB, the free backup storage provided will be at most 8 TB at no
  additional charge. In contrast, RA3 clusters and Amazon Redshift Serverless
  do not have this limitation mentioned, as they use Redshift Managed Storage
  which always has the latest copy of the data available.

  What is the relationship between a traffic policy and a policy record in Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow?

ANSWER: (559 chars)
  A traffic policy is a set of rules that defines how to route traffic to
  application endpoints, but by itself, it does not affect routing until it is
  associated with an application’s DNS name. This association is made through
  a policy record, which links the traffic policy to the appropriate DNS name
  within an Amazon Route 53 hosted zone. For example, to use a traffic policy
  named my-first-traffic-policy for www.example.com, a policy record must be
  created for www.example.com within the hosted zone, choosing
  my-first-traffic-policy as the traffic policy.

  How do metric based health checks in Amazon Route 53 enhance DNS failover capabilities?

ANSWER: (649 chars)
  Metric based health checks in Amazon Route 53 enhance DNS failover
  capabilities by allowing you to perform DNS failover based on any metric
  available within Amazon CloudWatch, including both AWS-provided metrics and
  custom metrics from your application. This means that the health check can
  become unhealthy whenever its associated CloudWatch metric enters an alarm
  state, which is particularly useful for endpoints that cannot be reached by
  standard health checks, such as instances with private IP addresses in a
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Additionally, they can be combined with
  standard health checks for more sophisticated failover scenarios.

ANSWER: (609 chars)
  To get started with S3 Vectors, you need to follow four steps: First,
  create a vector bucket in a specific AWS Region using the CreateVectorBucket
  API or in the S3 Console. Second, create a vector index in the vector bucket
  using the CreateIndex API or in the S3 Console, specifying the distance
  metric and the number of dimensions for the vectors. Third, add vector data
  to the vector index with the PutVectors API, optionally attaching metadata
  as key value pairs. Fourth, perform a similarity query with the QueryVectors
  API, specifying the vector to search for and the number of similar results
  to return.

QUESTION:
  How does creating a vector index differ from adding vector data to it?

ANSWER: (532 chars)
  Creating a vector index involves specifying parameters such as the vector
  bucket, index name, distance metric, dimensions, and optionally a list of
  metadata fields to exclude from filtering. In contrast, adding vector data
  to a vector index with the PutVectors API involves inserting the actual
  vector data and can include attaching metadata as key value pairs for
  filtering during queries. Essentially, creating an index sets up the
  framework for organizing and querying the vector data, while adding data
  populates that framework.

ANSWER: (561 chars)
  S3 Transfer Acceleration might be more beneficial when the source is

  Amazon Athena allows you to process multiple S3 objects in a single query,
  supports complex operations like joins and window functions, and operates
  directly on data stored in S3 without requiring data uploads. In contrast,
  client-side filtering involves downloading an S3 object to an AWS compute
  instance and filtering the contents using data analysis libraries on the
  client application, such as using the Pandas library in a Python

QUESTION:
  How do the optional capabilities of Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Macie compare to the core capabilities of Security Hub?

ANSWER: (521 chars)
  The optional capabilities of Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Macie differ from
  the core capabilities of Security Hub in that the core capabilities, which
  include Security Hub CSPM and Amazon Inspector scanning, are essential for
  using the enhanced Security Hub features like exposure findings and
  automated correlation analysis. In contrast, while Amazon GuardDuty and
  Amazon Macie provide additional security functionalities, they are not
  required to use Security Hub and are recommended for comprehensive security
  coverage.

QUESTION:
  How do Security Hub CSPM and AWS Config conformance packs differ in their approach to compliance management?

ANSWER: (621 chars)
  Security Hub CSPM is a core capability that provides security and
  compliance posture management as a service, primarily using AWS Config and
  AWS Config rules to evaluate the configuration of AWS resources. In
  contrast, AWS Config conformance packs are templates that package a group of
  AWS Config rules and associated remediation actions into a single entity,
  simplifying the management and deployment of rules across an organization.
  While Security Hub CSPM is geared towards operationalizing existing
  compliance standards, AWS Config conformance packs allow users to assemble
  their own compliance or security standards.

QUESTION:
  How does Amazon SNS integrate with other AWS services in an order processing workflow?

ANSWER: (562 chars)
  In an order processing workflow, Amazon SNS integrates with services like
  Amazon EC2, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SimpleDB. For instance, when a customer
  places an order, the transaction is recorded in Amazon SimpleDB, an
  application on EC2 forwards the order request to a payment processor, and
  upon approval, an order confirmation message is published to an SNS topic.
  This allows notifications to be sent to various subscribers, updating them
  about the payment processing status and orchestrating real-time processing
  in related systems like inventory or shipping.

QUESTION:
  What are the differences between the SSL connection for publishers and subscribers in Amazon SNS?

ANSWER: (509 chars)
  Publishers in Amazon SNS can connect over HTTPS and publish messages over
  an SSL channel, securing the messages sent to Amazon SNS. Subscribers, on
  the other hand, must register an SSL-enabled end-point during the
  subscription registration process, ensuring that notifications are delivered
  securely over an SSL channel to that end-point. Thus, while both publishers
  and subscribers can use SSL for security, their roles in this process
  differ, with publishers sending messages and subscribers receiving them.

ANSWER: (520 chars)
  The message delivery retry process in Amazon SNS operates the same for both
  client-side and server-side errors in terms of the retry policy applied,
  which includes four phases: retries with no delay, retries with minimum
  delay, retries according to a back-off model, and retries with maximum
  delay. However, the cause of failure differs: client-side errors are due to
  issues like deletion or permission changes of the endpoint, while
  server-side errors are due to the unavailability of the service powering the
  endpoint.

ANSWER: (541 chars)
  AWS Storage Gateway offers a range of features to integrate AWS storage
  with existing applications, utilizing protocols like iSCSI, SMB, and NFS. In
  contrast, Amazon S3 File Gateway specifically provides a file interface to
  store files as objects in Amazon S3 and is tailored for use cases like
  migrating on-premises file data to S3, backing up file data as objects, and
  enabling hybrid cloud workflows. While both serve to integrate on-premises
  applications with AWS storage, Amazon S3 File Gateway focuses on file
  storage as objects in S3.

QUESTION:
  How does the renaming of files and directories work in Amazon S3 File Gateway?

ANSWER: (536 chars)
  When you rename a file or directory in Amazon S3 File Gateway, the gateway
  performs copy-put requests to create a copy of the objects in S3 under the
  new keys and then deletes the original objects. This approach makes the
  rename operation appear atomic to clients, but it does not support renaming
  of objects directly. As a result, renaming directories containing a large
  number of files is not instantaneous, will create two copies of the data in
  S3, and will block operations in the directories until the rename operation
  is complete.

  What are the advantages of using snapshots for Volume Gateway volumes?

ANSWER: (502 chars)
  Using snapshots for Volume Gateway volumes allows you to take point-in-time
  snapshots in the form of Amazon EBS snapshots. This enables you to easily
  supply data from your on-premises applications to your applications running
  on Amazon EC2, which is beneficial for on-demand compute capacity for data
  processing or for disaster recovery purposes. Additionally, snapshots can
  preserve versions of your data, allowing you to revert to a prior version or
  repurpose a point-in-time version as a new volume.

  Alternatively, you can use an Internet gateway to enable Internet access
  from your VPC, allowing instances in the VPC to communicate with Amazon S3.
  Another option is to make all traffic to Amazon S3 traverse the Direct
  Connect or VPN connection, egress from your datacenter, and then re-enter
  the public AWS network.

QUESTION:
  What is the purpose of VPC flow logs in Amazon VPC?

ANSWER: (565 chars)
  VPC flow logs is a feature that allows you to capture information about the
  IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. It provides
  operational visibility about network dependencies and traffic patterns,
  helps detect anomalies and prevent data leakage, and assists in
  troubleshooting network connectivity and configuration issues. Additionally,
  the enriched metadata in flow logs offers insights about who initiated TCP
  connections and the packet-level source and destination for traffic flowing
  through intermediate layers such as the NAT Gateway.

QUESTION:
  How does the use of a VPC Endpoint for S3 compare to using an Internet gateway for Amazon S3 communication?

ANSWER: (504 chars)
  Using a VPC Endpoint for S3 ensures that all traffic remains within
  Amazon's network and allows the application of additional access policies to
  your Amazon S3 traffic. In contrast, using an Internet gateway enables
  Internet access from your VPC, allowing instances within the VPC to
  communicate with Amazon S3 over the public Internet. Therefore, the key
  difference is that a VPC Endpoint maintains traffic within Amazon's network
  while an Internet gateway allows communication over the public Internet.
